# sacrifice-and-succeed

There are no shortcuts in life.

There are only sacrifice, success and regrets.

The ones that sacrifice get to enjoy the success; while the rest regret their
weakness, cowardice and shameful mediocrity.

# task-units

These are the task units to be understood, followed and completed. There are no excuses.

The task units are to be followed exactly as they're outlined until one has
made enough progress in their life and career to meet the following criteria.

1. One has found their purpose in life before they're 27 years old.
2. One has achieved a physically strong and/or aesthetically pleasing appearance.
   Preferably a maximum of 70:30 ratio, or a barely acceptable minimum of 40:60 ratio
   in strength and aesthetics respectively. Not being able to protect one's loved ones
   from danger makes one unfit and unworthy. There are no excuses. Women and children
   are to be protected, and it's the duty of the man to do it.
3. One has enough financial assets to be able to take care of their family
   in case of an economic disaster (say unemployment due to a global pandemic).
4. One has cultivated their discipline to not give into the modern poisons of the
   mind, body and spirit : seeking/giving undeserved validation and attention on social media,
   online gambling, online prostitution, addiction to junk food,
   negative celebrity drama, popular mainstream low IQ+EQ entertainment, and many more.
5. One has started making success in their health, wealth, family and dating life.

The list is non-exhaustive, but will not be expanded [after completion, still work in progress], in order to cultivate
abstract thinking in the reader, and to promote further search of knowledge.

Until and unless all of the aims included above are fulfilled, the reader
may not try to find shortcuts in achieving their results, or question the validity
of the methods included. They're created from the teachings of men who are far
more successful than the majority of human population, and have been distilled
into a step by step form to mass replicate their consistent progress.

There's no place for non-helpful arguments here.

If it's said, "I know things are difficult right now. Be a man! Do the difficult things anyway!" There shouldn't be
any non-helpful objections of the form : "Well you cannot just define a man. It's
2021 for God's sake."

If one doesn't know what being a man is, their father has failed them. Seek help.

There shouldn't be any objections from someone who can't
bench-press 40 kilograms (88 pounds) for even one repetition. Their objection
has no worth here. We're here to do hard things and win in this horrid world.
Not to listen to someone complain.

It doesn't  mean that questions are bad. Any question asked from a place of
good faith will be answered with full enthusiasm. We'll build a community, and
discuss things to improve and succeed. Gate-keeping for quality control is a necessary evil.

Now, If you follow the tasks units, there's no guarantee for success after completion.
That would be taking a shortcut. There's only a guarantee for self motivation,
consistent progress, sense of worth, hunger for success, an unrelenting lust
towards self improvement and brutal aggression while crushing one's goals.

**_We will try to save as many as we can. Last rites for the rest._**
